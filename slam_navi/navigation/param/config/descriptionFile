Max/min  velocity  and  acceleration  are  two  basic  parameters  for  the  mobile  base.Setting  them  correctly  is  very  helpful  for  optimal  local  planner  behavior
In  ROS navigation, we need to know translational and rotational velocity and acceleration.

Translational velocity(m/s) is the velocity when robot is moving in a straight line
Rotationalvelocity(rad/s) is equivalent as angular velocity.
For safety, we prefer to set maximum translational and rotational velocities to belower than their actual maximum values
